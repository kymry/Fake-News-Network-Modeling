# A machine learning model based on epidemic models to simulate the spread of fake news over a social media network

Fake news is wide-spread and is a threat to democracy and truth worldwide. In order to effectively combat
fake news, it is essential to understand how the fake news spread over a network. The goal of
this project is to learn the parameters of a machine learning model to accurately simulation
